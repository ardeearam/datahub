# Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database

*Note: To view the full metadata for this data source, please see the raw file in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dataengineeringpilipinas/datahub/tree/main/data-sources).*

## Description
The Global Findex is the first public database of indicators that measures people's use of financial services across economies and over time. Based on over 150,000 interviews across more than 140 economies, the database can be used to develop a deeper understanding of how people save, borrow, make payments, and manage risk.

## Data Collection Methodology
Data was collected through surveys conducted by the World Bank

## How to Access
Access the [metadata catalog](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/global-findex/?page=1&ps=15&repo=global-findex) for this database.

## Data Dictionary
Each survey has a unique data dictionary. This is an [example from the 2021 iteration](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/4607/data-dictionary/F1?file_name=micro_world_139countries.dta).

## Relevance to Philippine Data Projects
This is a useful way to assess our level of financial inclusion relative to those of other global economies. It can help guide development efforts for policy makers and financial institutions in the country.

## Known Issues or Limitations
Each iteration of the survey has a different format, adapting to global trends in financial inclusion. This makes it difficult to integrate them into a time series, as columns that have similar semantic meanings may be represented differently in each survey.
